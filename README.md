The ros_watchdog observers ROS1 topics and nodes, as well as system-defined drivers. Its settings are specified in INI-
files, which can be specified as ROS1 parameters used during initalization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequesites
This package is part of the [CNS FlightStack] and thus depends on the other packages of the flight stack:
- [CNS FlightStack: Autonomy Engine]

Further the following libraries are required
- Python3
- ROS noetic

### Build

As this is a ROS package, please build it within the catkin environment with

```bash
catkin build watchdog_bringup # will automatically build ros_watchdog
```

## Usage

The intended usage is together with the [CNS FlightStack: Autonomy Engine], which will interact with the watchdog. Use the provided launchfile to start the watchdog

```bash
roslaunch watchdog_bringup watchdog.launch 
```

### Default Launchfile Parameters

| Launch parameter | description | default value |
|:----------------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| `node_name`           | name of the node to be launched | `watchdog` |
| `status_o`            | out topic where status is published | `<node_name>/status` |
| `status_service_o`    | in service where status can be requested | `<node_name>/status` |
| `start_service_o`     | in service where watchdog is activated | `<node_name>/start` |
| `entity_check_rate`   | rate at which entities are checked (in Hz) | `2.0` |
| `drivers_cfg_file`    | config file for drivers or other scripts | `<watchdog_bringup>/config/drivers.ini` |
| `topics_cfg_file`     | config file for ROS1 topics | `<watchdog_bringup>/config/topics.ini` |
| `nodes_cfg_file`      | config file for ROS1 nodes | `<watchdog_bringup>/config/nodes.ini` |
| `do_verbose`          | enable verbose flag | `false` |

### Usage without Autonomy Engine

If required the watchdog can be used without the [CNS FlightStack: Autonomy Engine]. 
The easiest way to do this is to start the watchdog with the provided service: 

```bash
rosservice call /watchdog/service/start "header:
  seq: 0
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: ''
startup_time: 10.0" # any time >(2/<rate>) should be provided here 

# feedback as Status.msg
header: 
  seq: 1
  stamp: 
    secs: <current_secs>
    nsecs: <current_nsecs>
  frame_id: "ros_watchdog"
successful: True|False
status: 
  entity: ''
  type: 0
  status: 0|1|2|4|8
  name: "/watchdog/global"
  info: "
    Status ObserverKeys.TOPIC: <no entries to watch>|0|1|2|4|8
    Status ObserverKeys.NODE: <no entries to watch>|0|1|2|4|8
    Status ObserverKeys.DRIVER: <no entries to watch>|0|1|2|4|8"
entity_ids: [...]
```

The status can be one of the following and is defined in the [`Status.msg`](watchdog_msgs/msg/Status.msg)
- `0`: undefined condition
- `1`: nominal condition
- `2`: startup phase (while the service call is active only, i.e., the duration `startup_time`)
- `4`: inconvenient failure (but topic/node/driver is still active)
- `8`: severe failure (no communication of topic/node/driver)

## Architecture

Please refer to the [academic paper] for further insights of the ros_watchdog

## Known Issues

None at this point in time, please submit an issue request using the git interface if any issues arise.
